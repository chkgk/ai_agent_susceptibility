            <h2>Counting Task Instructions</h2>
            
            <p>
                Welcome to the counting task experiment. In this task, you will be presented with a grid containing 
                zeros and ones, and your job is to count how many ones appear in the grid.
            </p>
            
            <h4>What you need to do:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Look carefully at the grid image that will be displayed</li>
                <li>Count all the cells that contain the number "1"</li>
                <li>Enter your count in the input field provided</li>
                <li>Click the "Next" button to submit your answer</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Important notes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Take your time to count accurately</li>
                <li>Each grid is randomly generated, so every participant sees a different pattern</li>
                <li>Only count the cells containing "1" - ignore the cells with "0"</li>
                <li>Double-check your count before submitting</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> You may find it helpful to count systematically, 
                for example by going row by row or column by column.
